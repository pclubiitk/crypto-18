# Overheard

## Problem Description (Shared)

You are agent Carter in the middle of World War 2.
You are intercepting Hydra's secret messages to find the location of their secret warehouses.

You have tapped into their phone lines, but the message you have overheard definitely seems familiar... there's definitely something hidden in it...

You need to decode this fast and give this to Captain America before Captain Communism takes over.
