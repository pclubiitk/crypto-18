# TimeStone

## Problem Description (Shared)

Everyone likes to play games right?
We have created a level up game for you, give us the correct answer and advance to next level.

**PS**: A hint will be provided in some time if no one can solve this.
(Name is a hint as well!)

## Setup

Just execute the bash script **server.sh**.

## Solution

This question was based on the timeline of Marvel movies and TV Shows according to the first episode release date, (*TimeStone* is a hint for the problem, relating something to timeline or time specific events.)

You can try out inputs for this but when you realize (probably after 2 or 3 inputs) that it is marvel universe timeline, you can google for **Marvel Universe Timeline** and find many links for the marvel universe timeline, the first one I found was [this](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline).

Now, just keep giving the answers in the order of timeline and you will get the flag.
